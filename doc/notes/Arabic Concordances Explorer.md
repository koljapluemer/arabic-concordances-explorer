- [[data-driven learning]] applied to [[learning arabic]]
- [[Concordances]]-based tools are better done offline (â†’ [[godot]]), because you often need large amounts of data...

## Possible Sources

- [Sinai Corpus](https://github.com/mohabmes/Sinai-corpus/blob/master/src/sample.txt): the first thing you find, but weird encoding, and I'm not sure how to use it (sparsely documented)
- <https://github.com/linuxscout/tashkeela2/blob/master/data/Interviews/Int07.xml> seems like a decent amount of data (diverse topics), but it's spread out across folders and xml files which would need cleaning and merging
- [1800 Tweets](https://github.com/komari6/Arabic-twitter-corpus-AJGT), Jordanian or MSA, but in xlsx
- [Arabic wikipedia](https://github.com/motazsaad/arwikiExtracts), comes with dump, corpus and instructions
- [undocumented zip corpus](https://github.com/almoslmi/masc)
- [Arabic Big Corpus](https://github.com/mohataher/arabic_big_corpus), which is not actually very big and may be exclusively Qran
